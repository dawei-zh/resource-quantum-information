## Exercise 4.1.16

A POVM is defined as a set of operators $\{\Lambda_{j}\}$ that satisfy the following two conditions, 
$$
\forall\;j: \Lambda_j \geq 0 \text{ and }\sum_j \Lambda_j = I\tag{1}
$$
The "Chrysler" states for $k\in\{0,1,2,3,4\}$ are given by
$$
|e_k\rangle \equiv \cos\frac{2\pi k}{5}|0\rangle +\sin\frac{2\pi k}{5}|1\rangle   \tag{2}
$$
In the following, we need to check whether the operator 
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{2}{5}|e_k\rangle \langle e_k| &= \frac{2}{5}(\cos\frac{2\pi k}{5}|0\rangle +\sin\frac{2\pi k}{5}|1\rangle)(\cos\frac{2\pi k}{5}\langle 0| +\sin\frac{2\pi k}{5}\langle 1|) \\
&= 
\end{align}\tag{3}
$$
are both positive and complete. For an arbitrary state $|v\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle$,
