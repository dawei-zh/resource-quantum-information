## Exercise 3.3.11

Suppose that $A$ is Hermitian and it can be decomposed into the form $A = \sum_{i} a_{1}|i\rangle\langle i|$, where $|i\rangle$ is a set of orthonormal basis, the function of an operator $A$â€‹ is defined by
$$
f(A) = \sum_{i}f(a_i)|i\rangle\langle i|\tag{1}\label{1}
$$
When it comes to the rotation operator $R_{X}(\phi) = \exp \{iX\phi/2\}$, since $|+\rangle$ and $|-\rangle$ are eigenvectorwe can write $X$ into the form as eq. $\eqref{1}$, 
$$
X = |+\rangle\langle +
$$
