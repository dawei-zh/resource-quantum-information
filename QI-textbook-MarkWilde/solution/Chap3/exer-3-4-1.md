## Exercise 3.4.1

In quantum mechanics, the measurement result is the eigenvalues of the observable. For observable $X$, its eigenvectors are $|+\rangle$ and $|-\rangle$ with eigenvalue as $+1$ and $-1$, respectively. Thus, if we measure observable $X$, we would get two possible measurement outputs $+1$ and $-1$ corresponding two post-measurement states $|+\rangle$ and $|-\rangle$, respectively. 

With above information, we can write observable $X$ in the diagonal representation,
$$
X = |+\rangle\langle +| - |-\rangle\langle -|\tag{1}
$$
According to the definition of von Neumann measurement, since $\langle+|-\rangle = 0$, the $\{|+\rangle, |-\rangle \}$ is an orthonormal basis, so the measurement operators of $X$ are $\Pi_+ = |+\rangle\langle +|$ and $\Pi_- = |-\rangle\langle -|$.
